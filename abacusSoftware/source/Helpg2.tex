\section*{Introduction}
The $g^{(2)}$ function is calculated as follows:

\begin{equation*}
g^{(2)}(\tau)=\frac{N_{12}(\tau)T}{2N_1N_2\Delta_{tw}}
\end{equation*}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N_{12}(\tau)$ are the coincidences of the chosen channels found at each point.
    \item $N_1$ are the total counts of the chosen channel 1.
    \item $N_2$ are the total counts of the chosen channel 2.
    \item $T$ is the sampling time,
    \item $\Delta_{tw}$ = $  (CoinW + \frac{res}{2})$. ($CoinW$ is the coincidence window and $res$ is the resolution)
\end{itemize}
